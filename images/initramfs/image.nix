  # ── Why this flake exists ─────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Every sealed mvm workload boots from a tiny, content-addressed
  # initramfs.  The initramfs carries exactly one executable: a static
  # `mvm-guest-agent` binary installed as `/init` so the kernel execs it
  # as PID 1.  PID 1 then listens on vsock for an `ActivateEnvironment`
  # message from the host, mounts the verified rootfs + runtime overlay,
  # drops privilege, and starts the workload.
  #
  # The initramfs deliberately contains NO busybox, NO setpriv, NO
  # shells, NO secrets, and NO runtime overlay; all of that arrives from
  # the host after activation.  The result is a single, small artifact
  # shared by every workload rootfs image for a given (arch, agent
  # version, kernel version) tuple.
  #
  # Output layout under `$out/`:
  #
  #   initramfs.cpio.gz  — the gzip-compressed cpio the VMM loads as
  #                        the guest initrd.
  #   initramfs.hash     — SHA-256 of the uncompressed cpio payload,
  #                        exposed as a passthru so the host can select
  #                        the correct initramfs by content hash.
  #   initramfs.size     — byte size of the compressed artifact.
  #   VERSION            — semver of the producing mvmctl, matching the
  #                        runtime overlay VERSION contract.
  #
  # The Nix derivation output path itself is content-addressed by the
  # inputs (arch, agent derivation, kernel version parameter), so the
  # hash file is a convenience for the runtime resolver rather than the
  # source of truth.
