  description = "mvm builder VM image — kernel + rootfs.ext4 with Nix + tools + mvm-host-vm-init (Plan 72 W2)";

  # ── Why this flake exists ────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # This flake is the artifact the builder VM boots into: a small Linux
  # kernel + ext4 rootfs containing Nix + a curated build-tools subset +
  # `mvm-host-vm-init` at `/sbin/mvm-host-vm-init`.
  #
  # `packages.<system>.default` produces `$out/{vmlinux,rootfs.ext4,
  # cmdline.txt,manifest.json}`.
  #
  # A source-checkout `mvmctl` locates this flake through
  # `find_builder_vm_flake`.
  #
  # ── Architecture / workspace staging ──────────────────────────────
  #
  # - Stage the workspace via `builtins.path` (filter out `target/`,
  #   `.git/`, etc.) so the flake works both on a host running
  #   `nix build` directly and inside the libkrun builder VM's
  #   `path:` URL fetch.
  # - `MVM_WORKSPACE_PATH` env var override for the sandbox case
  #   (avoids resolving `../../..` against the flake's own store copy,
  #   which does not contain the workspace).
  # - Call the `mvm` flake's `outputs` directly (`nix/flake.nix`) for
  #   mkGuest, the guest recipes and the host-binaries manifest — no
  #   flake-input chain, so no path-input lock validation issue.
  #
  # ── Builder VM package set ────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Narrower than the interactive image:
  #
  # - Static busybox (provides `/bin/sh`, `udhcpc`, `sync`, basic
  #   POSIX utilities — small footprint).
  # - Nix (the whole point of the VM).
  # - Bash + coreutils + gnugrep / gnused / gawk / findutils / which
  #   (user's `cmd.sh` is shell, not necessarily POSIX-only).
  # - Git + gnumake + curl + jq (Nix flakes pull from git, builds
  #   often run make / curl, `cmd.sh` may format JSON).
  # - e2fsprogs (`mkfs.ext4` for the first-boot format of the
  #   persistent `/nix` store) + util-linux (`mount`, `umount`,
  #   `losetup`).
  # - iproute2 (used by `udhcpc` and friends; small).
  # - iptables — defense-in-depth: `mvm-host-vm-init` installs an
  #   OUTPUT-chain default-deny + uid-owner ACCEPT for
  #   `mvm-egress-proxy` (uid 1801), so a build step that ignores
  #   `HTTP_PROXY` cannot reach upstream. See
  #   `crates/mvm-host-vm-init/src/network.rs`.
  # - **No** `procps`-interactive / `less` — kept slim.
  # - `mvm-host-vm-init` mounted at `/sbin/mvm-host-vm-init` via
  #   `extraFiles`. The kernel cmdline (`cmdline.txt` output)
  #   chains into it from the generic `/init` bootstrap.
