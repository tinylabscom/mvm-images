# Workload-guest kernel for in-guest orchestrators — Linux 6.12.
#
# = the shared base (`nix/images/kernel/base.nix`) + the same dm-verity
# delta `workload.nix` carries (verified boot, virtio-fs volumes) + the
# cgroup / namespace / netfilter plumbing a Kubernetes guest (rootless k3s,
# see specs/plans/2026-09-20-kubernetes-in-microvm.md) needs:
#
#   CGROUPS + controllers   — the kubelet and containerd place every pod
#                 container in cgroups; without a mounted hierarchy they
#                 cannot start anything.
#   NAMESPACES + per-ns     — every container is a netns/mount/ipc/pid/uts/
#                 cgroup namespace; USER_NS is what makes the rootless
#                 control plane possible at the mvm workload uid.
#   NETFILTER + conntrack/
#                 iptables    — kube-proxy and the CNI program in-guest
#                 pod/service rules. The guest still has no NIC: this is
#                 the cluster-internal datapath, not a host-facing firewall.
#   BRIDGE / VETH / VXLAN   — the in-guest pod network (flannel).
#   DEVPTS_FS /
#     POSIX_MQUEUE          — container ptys (`kubectl exec`) and POSIX
#                 mqueue mounts.
#
# Where `workload.nix` *required-disables* CGROUPS / NAMESPACES / NETFILTER
# for the sealed single-workload posture (and the config budget ratchet in
# `xtask check-kernel-config-budget` covers only the sealed workload
# kernel), this variant keeps them: hosting a kubelet IS the posture. It is
# deliberately outside the tiny-kernel budget — measure it with
# `workload-k8s-metrics` and record the cost where the variant is adopted.
#
# Kept disabled from the workload delta: eBPF (BPF_SYSCALL), perf,
# checkpoint/restore, loop/md-raid, 9p/btrfs, IPv6 tunnel/IPsec families.
# Degraded metrics are acceptable for a dev/test-tier cluster; each cut
# revisited when a smoke test proves a hard need.
