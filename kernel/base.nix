# Shared kernel-config foundation for mvm's custom microVM kernels.
#
# One source of truth for the slim, all-built-in (`CONFIG_MODULES=n`)
# Linux config that every mvm guest boots. Two kernels are derived from
# it via `mkKernel`'s `extra{Enables,Disables}` deltas:
#
#   - workloadKernel = mkKernel { }                  (base only)
#   - builderKernel  = mkKernel { extraEnables = …;} (base + builder infra)
#
# The base set is the minimal config a *sealed workload guest* needs to
# boot under libkrun / Firecracker and reach the host over virtio +
# vsock. The builder VM is a superset: it additionally mounts virtio-fs
# host shares, overlays a persistent `/nix` store, runs the nix-build
# sandbox (user namespaces + cgroups), and installs an iptables egress
# lockdown — none of which a workload guest needs. Those land in the
# builder's `extraEnables` (see `nix/images/kernel/builder.nix`).
#
# Why slim / all-built-in: a stock `pkgs.linuxPackages.kernel` ships
# the features we need as `=m`, forcing every consumer to ship a
# `/lib/modules/<kver>/` tree and modprobe each one at the right moment
# (overlay before mount, vsock before socket(), iptables before rule
# install). Each `=m` is a silent-failure surface. Flipping everything
# we need to `=y` makes modprobe a no-op and deletes the module tree.
# Five distinct ways the module contract broke during validation drove
# this decision.
#
# Why no TSI patches: builder-VM networking moved to vsock. The TSI
# syscall-hijack path is gone
# from every VM, and the vendored 22-file patch series was dropped.
#
# Tradeoff — first build compiles from source: because the `.config` is
# novel, `cache.nixos.org` has no substitute, so a fresh machine
# compiles the kernel once (3-5 min on Apple Silicon, ~10 min slower).
# Sharing the base means the builder and workload kernels reuse most of
# the same closure, and `mvmctl kernel build` (+ the hash-keyed GHA
# prebuilt) move that cost out of the hot build loop.

    # Shrink batch 1 — leaf driver subsystems defconfig pulls in that a
    # headless virtio microVM never touches (console is hvc0 + vsock; no
    # firmware blobs, no input devices, no host sensors/watchdog). None are
    # transitive deps of the keep-set (virtio/vsock/ext4/overlay/dm-verity).
    "FW_LOADER" # request_firmware infra — no driver here loads blobs
    "FIREWIRE" # IEEE-1394 host stack
    "INPUT"
    "SERIO" # input core + PS/2 serial-IO; no virtio-input/keyboard
    "HWMON" # hardware monitoring sensors
    "WATCHDOG" # watchdog timers

    # Shrink batch 2 — self-contained subsystems + SoC bus/pin/PMIC drivers
    # defconfig drags in. The SoC `ARCH_*` clusters are already off; these are
    # the orthogonal driver menus that survive that. None are on the virtio
    # microVM boot path (no GPIO/I2C/pinctrl/PMIC hardware; FDT boot, not EFI;
    # not a ChromeOS board). Netfilter is NOT cut here — the builder kernel
    # needs it for its egress lockdown; the workload kernel drops it on its
    # own (workload.nix extraDisables), since base is shared by both.
    "CHROME_PLATFORMS" # ChromeOS embedded-controller drivers
    "EFI" # arm64 boots from the FDT, never the EFI stub/runtime
    "I2C" # no I2C buses behind virtio
    "GPIOLIB" # no GPIO controllers
    "PINCTRL" # SoC pin-mux
    "MFD_CORE" # multi-function (PMIC) device core

    # NOTE: PCI is intentionally NOT disabled — QEMU attaches virtio over PCI,
    # so PCI + VIRTIO_PCI are in the enable list above. libkrun/Firecracker/HVF
    # (MMIO) simply don't probe it. Dropping PCI here has broken boot on a
    # PCI-attached backend before.

    # Shrink batch 4 — more whole subsystems a sealed virtio microVM never
    # uses. Each cascades its family (drivers + helpers) via olddefconfig.
    "NFS_FS" # no network filesystems mounted
    "PHYLIB"
    "MDIO_DEVICE" # ethernet PHY mgmt — virtio-net has no PHY
    "VFIO" # device passthrough — unused (no PCI passthrough)
    "IPMI_HANDLER" # no BMC / out-of-band mgmt
    "CPU_FREQ"
    "CPU_IDLE" # no DVFS/idle-governor in a guest
    "SPI" # no SPI buses behind virtio (drops SPI flash/RTC/…)
    "NVMEM" # no on-board NVMEM providers
    "PWM" # no PWM controllers

    # Shrink batch 5 — subsystems the proven-minimal libkrun guest also drops.
    # Console stays: x86 keeps 8250; ARM keeps PL011; both keep virtio-console.
    # Only the SoC vendor UARTs go here. IOMMU is safe to drop — virtio rides
    # MMIO with direct DMA, no translation unit.
    "CORESIGHT" # ARM hardware trace/debug — never wired in a guest
    "VIRTUALIZATION" # a guest doesn't host nested VMs (drops KVM)

    "SERIAL_MCTRL_GPIO"
    "SERIAL_DEV_BUS" # SoC/serdev UARTs — console is PL011

    # Shrink batch 6 — block-device *clients* defconfig builds in that no mvm
    # backend can ever drive. Every guest boots one virtio-blk disk (`vda`,
    # kept via VIRTIO_BLK above); libkrun / HVF / Firecracker present no NBD
    # server and no NVMe controller, so these drivers register phantom devices
    # (nbd0–15) and idle rescuer workqueue threads (16× kworker/R-nbd*, 3×
    # kworker/R-nvme) with nothing behind them. A workload *cannot* reach them —
    # there is no host-side device — so dropping them is pure attack-surface +
    # thread-count reduction with zero functional loss on any boot path.
    # Only NBD/NVMe live here (shared base): they are universally dead — no
    # host-side device exists on any backend, so neither the builder nor a
    # workload can reach them. The sibling block-driver drops BLK_DEV_LOOP and
    # BLK_DEV_MD are scoped to workload.nix instead: the builder kernel may
    # loop-mount while assembling images, and BLK_DEV_MD only materialises where
    # the CONFIG_MD umbrella is enabled (workload's dm-verity delta). See
    # workload.nix.
    "BLK_DEV_NBD" # network block device — no NBD server on any backend
    "BLK_DEV_NVME"
